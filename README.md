This is the first demo of git and github.

Here we have working directory ,staging area, git repo and github.

i.e., local and remote.


in local we have to do three things
initiate git repo.
1.create file 
2.add it to staging area
3.commit to git repo

after every step we have to check git status.


next we have push this git repo in to github.
